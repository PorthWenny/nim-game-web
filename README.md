# Nim Game on the Web 🖥️

Welcome to the Nim Game project! This web application allows you to play the classic Nim game against an AI that calculates the optimal play every round. The goal is to avoid being the player who takes the last object from the heap. 

## Features

- Github connection to track your win percentage.
- Easy-to-understand rules for new players.

## How to Play

3. Take turns to remove objects from the heap(s). Left-click to select from a stack, right-click to remove from a selection.
4. The player forced to take the last object loses the game.
